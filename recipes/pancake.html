      Pancake recipe to make your day. My favorite way
      of eating it is whit chocolate sauce and whipped cream,
      but don't let me stop your imagination. Pancakes are 
      great because you have endless possibilities in
      toppings that you can use.

    <ul>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups of milk</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl; add milk, flour, sugar, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, and vanilla extract and mix until batter is very thin.
      </li>
      <li>Heat a pan over medium heat; add about 1 teaspoon oil. Pour a small amount of batter onto the griddle and tip griddle to spread the batter into a thin layer; cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancake and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Roll pancake and place on a plate. Repeat with remaining batter.
