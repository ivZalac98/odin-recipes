    <p>Simple whipped cream recipe, nothing more to it. But it is a fantastic topping for pancakes.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, whip cream until stiff peaks are just about to form. Beat in vanilla and sugar until peaks form. Make sure not to over-beat, cream will then become lumpy and butter-like.</li>
    </ol>
